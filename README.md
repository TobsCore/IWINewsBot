# Telegram Bot for IWI Faculty IWINews

The [IWINewsBot](http://t.me/IWINewsBot) has been developed by [Tobias Kerst](https://github.com/TobsCore) and [Anna-Lena Schwarzkopf](https://github.com/zckrbrt) as a project at HS Karlsruhe. The bot informs about news posted to the black board of the IWI (Computer Science) faculty.

## Features
Users can subscribe to messages by starting a conversation with the bot (`/start`) or by pressing the `Start`-Button. They can then configure what messages they want to receive by the `/settings` command. The bot then sends them messages posted to the board, but only to those topics that the user subscribed to.

`/mensa` returns information about the daily mensa menu.

`/profs` provides a list of lecturers, which can be used to receive additional information about the, such as their location, their email-address or their consultation-hours.

`/help` gives detailed information about the bot's features.

## Chatbot
The bot has some chatbot functionality that is enabled by rivescript. To check out, what's possible, use the `/help` command.

## Compilation
The bot is developed with the Scala programming language. The build tool is sbt. After cloning the project, one has to create a file called `bot.token` and place the token (generated by the BotFather) in it. The bot can then be compiled by running:

```
> sbt compile
```

In addition to running the bot with `sbt run`, sbt-assembly is used to generate a fat-jar. This can be achieved by running

```
> sbt assembly
```
